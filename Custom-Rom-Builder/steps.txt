Hi everyone, this is a short guide on how to flash a GSI on the A7 Lite (without TWRP).

Its a nice little tablet for the price but it doesn't have a very powerful SOC and for me the One UI is barely usable on this device. The launcher and the whole system UI feel extremely laggy, but apps generally run fine.

I tried phhusson's custom Android 12 GSI and the device was almost resurrected. Much much less UI lag and the battery life is the same as stock ROM. The only thing i found not working is MTP but i don't need it.

Since i saw a couple users here asking about GSIs i decided to make a very simple guide.

As always do this at your own risk. You may brick your device. You will void your warranty.

Follow the guide only if you know what your are doing. Read each step carefully and avoid copy pasting stuff randomly.

I won't go deep into details as i believe you should have some basic knowledge if you decide to do this.

The procedure sould work for both T220 and T225 (i tested it on a T220).

I did this on Windows using WSL for some of the steps.

- tar-md5-script-tool

Use the attached tar-md5-script-tool.zip

Steps​

1. Extract official ROM files (BL, AP, CP, CSC)

2. Extract AP .tar.md5

3. Decompress the extracted super.img.lz4

Code:
lz4 -d super.img.lz4 super.img

4. Convert the sparse super.img

Code:
simg2img super.img super.ext4.img

5. Unpack super.ext4.img

Code:
lpunpack super.ext4.img

I got 4 partitions in my image (should be the same for all T220/T225 ROMs):

- odm.img
- product.img
- system.img
- vendor.img

6. Replace system.img with your GSI (rename it to system.img)

7. Get the size of all partitions and the size of the original super.ext4.img (not the sparse super.img)

Code:
stat -c '%n %s' IMG_FILE.img

8. Repack super.img

Code:
lpmake --metadata-size 65536 \
--super-name super \
--metadata-slots 2 \
--device super:ORIGINAL_SUPER_IMG_SIZE \
--group main:SUM_OF_ALL_PARTITIONS_SIZES \
--partition odm:readonly:ODM_PARTITION_SIZE:main \
--image odm=./odm.img \
--partition product:readonly:PRODUCT_PARTITION_SIZE:main \
--image product=./product.img \
--partition system:readonly:SYSTEM_PARTITION_SIZE:main \
--image system=./system.img \
--partition vendor:readonly:VENDOR_PARTITION_SIZE:main \
--image vendor=./vendor.img \
--sparse \
--output ./super_new.img

Replace ORIGINAL_SUPER_IMG_SIZE, SUM_OF_ALL_PARTITIONS_SIZES, ODM_PARTITION_SIZE, PRODUCT_PARTITION_SIZE, SYSTEM_PARTITION_SIZE, VENDOR_PARTITION_SIZE with the values you obtained in step 7.

Read lpmake docs for a more detailed expalation of the args used above:

partition_tools - platform/system/extras - Git at Google

9. Compress the repacked super_new.img

Code:
lz4 -B6 --content-size super_new.img super_new.img.lz4

10. Compress the clean vmbeta.img

Code:
lz4 -B6 --content-size vbmeta.img vbmeta.img.lz4

11. Extract tar-md5-script-tool.zip

12. Put all the *.img.lz4 files extracted from AP .tar.gz in tar-md5-script-tool dir

13. Replace super.img.lz4 and vbmeta.img.lz4 in tar-md5-script-tool dir with your repacked and compressed super_new.img.lz4 (rename it to super.img.lz4) and the clean compressed vbmeta.img.lz4

14. Run batch.bat in tar-md5-script-tool dir

You will find the new AP .tar.md5 in the temp-folder subdir

15. Flash your custom AP .tar.md5 with Odin along with BL, CP, CSC from original ROM

16. Reboot into recovery and do a factory reset

17. Done
